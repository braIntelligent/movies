Movie Search App
A project that connects to a movie API and displays results in a styled frontend.

Backend
Technologies used:

Express: Handles the server and routing.

Axios: Makes HTTP requests to the movie API.

CORS: Enables communication between frontend and backend (cross-origin).

Features:
Creates an API endpoint to fetch movie data.

Acts as a middleware between the external movie API and the React frontend.

Frontend
Technologies used:

React: Builds the user interface and handles routing with react-router-dom.

Bootstrap: Adds responsive and styled UI components.

Features:
Search bar to look for movies.

Dynamic display of movie posters.

Detail page for each movie when clicking a poster.

How It Works
Frontend sends a request to the backend when a user searches for a movie.

Backend uses Axios to call the external movie API.

The response is sent back and rendered in the frontend.
